README file for C++ programming project

This is an initial git repository for your programming project.
It contains an initial directory structure that we wish you could
use as follows:

  * `plan/' -- Here is your project plan. You may use different sources,
    but we hope to get the pan **also as pdf file**.

  * `doc/` -- here are the documentation sources related to your project.
    You may use different tools for documentation (e.g. latex),
    but we hope to get the final version of the document
    **also as pdf file**.

  * `src/` -- here are the C++ source files. You can have subfolders as needed.

  * `README.md` -- This file that you should modify to represent
    your project.


How to run the game

First, navigate to the src folder.
Write the next commands (for building and running the game for the first time) to the terminal when in src folder:
1. chmod +x hillclimb.sh
2. ./hillclimb.sh
Wait for a while when the game builds. When the build is ready the main menu screen will open automatically.
3. Enjoy the game!

After that you need to run the command: ./main to run the game again.
